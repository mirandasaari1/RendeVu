# RendeVu
### Created by: Anna Pomelov, Josh Smith, Miranda Saari and Sal Hernandez

#### Functionality
As of now our app has the basic structure for the core functionality. A user can add dates they have planned including details for the dates. As they begin their date, chaperones are notified and there to ensure their safety. RendeVu keeps track of main locations and provides ways for the dater to safely get out of the date if needed as well as update the chaperones. Dater also has a log of their planned and past dates

#### Handin 1
For the first milestone we were able to
* develop goals for each milestone completion
* make the shell of the app, this mainly includes the functions of the apps the dater will have access to
* Implememnt an API call from google maps to pull the daters locations.

#### Handin 2
For the second milestone we were able to
* make an active date page for once the dater begins their date, it will put the app in a different mode so the date is seen as active.
* Persistence was included so we are saving the locations to a python server and sending them back down to our mobile device. 
* Implement a login/sign up for the user through google and facebook
* Deploy the app to the market
* Develop and icon/logo for RendeVu
* Improve the overall UI for RendeVu and develop an overall color scheme/theme

#### Handin 3
For the third milestone a lot of the loose end came together and we were able to
* set up twilio to send texts
* get the active date activity up and running for when the user is on dates
* set up a local sqlite database
* set up a server database
* persist to both the databases
* rule out minor issues we had previously encountered
* work out the overall flow of the application
* Set up beginning and endpoints via server
* give the user ability to select date chaperones

#### Known Problems
We do know some problems currently exist, and we plan to work them out before the final presenation, such as
* connect the chaperones to the date, meaning be able to select chaperones per date
* Work on the navigation bar, the formatting is off on some activities
* work on the efficiency of the server database
#### Pretty such it is fixed, but just in case
* app crashing on the date comfort spinner
* authentication issues

#### With more time we would...
We did have really high hopes for what we wished to accomplish by the end of this project, and we stil have potential for a lot.
Although the basics of the application are working great, we had a lot of date safety features we wanted the application to have,
but the basics took a little longer than expected. We hope to implement some extra safety features by the final presentation.

## We Hope You Enjoy RenduVu!
