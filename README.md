# RendeVu
### Created by: Anna Pomelov, Josh Smith, Miranda Saari and Sal Hernandez

#### Functionality
As of now our app has the basic structure for the core functionality. A user can add dates they have planned including details for the dates. As they begin their date, chaperones are notified and there to ensure their safety. RendeVu keeps track of main locations and provides ways for the dater to safely get out of the date if needed as well as update the chaperones. Dater also has a log of their planned and past dates

#### Handin 1
For the first milestone we were able to
* develop goals for each milestone completion
* make the shell of the app, this mainly includes the functions of the apps the dater will have access to
* Implememnt an API call from google maps to pull the daters locations.

#### Handin 2
For the second milestone we were able to
* make an active date page for once the dater begins their date, it will put the app in a different mode so the date is seen as active.
* Persistence was included so we are saving the locations to a python server and sending them back down to our mobile device. 
* Implement a login/sign up for the user through google and facebook
* Deploy the app to the market
* Develop and icon/logo for RendeVu
* Improve the overall UI for RendeVu and develop an overall color scheme/theme
