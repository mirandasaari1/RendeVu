# RendeVu
### Developed by: Anna Pomelov, Josh Smith, Miranda Saari and Sal Hernandez

#### What can RendeVu do for you?
##### Create your profile
##### Add your planned dates
##### Add your chaperones
##### Begin your Date
While on your date here is what we will do to protect you
+ track your location
+ notify your chaperones upon your request
+ check in, discretely, to see how you are doing
+ allow quick ways for you to flee the date

#### Functionality
As of now our app has the basic structure for the core functionality. A user can add dates they have planned including details for the dates. As they begin their date, chaperones are notified and there to ensure their safety. RendeVu keeps track of main locations and provides ways for the dater to safely get out of the date if needed as well as update the chaperones. Dater also has a log of their planned and past dates

#### Future Work...
We did have really high hopes for what we wished to accomplish by the end of this project, and we stil have potential for a lot.
Although the basics of the application are working great, we had a lot of date safety features we wanted the application to have,
but the basics took a little longer than expected. We hope to implement some extra safety features by the final presentation.

## We Hope You Enjoy RenduVu!
